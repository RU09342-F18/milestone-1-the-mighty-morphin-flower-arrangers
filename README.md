# Milestone 1: Stranger Things Light Wall

This project creates an addressable RGB LED which can be connected in series with another board running the same program to create a pattern of colors based on an input of a specified number of bytes, initially sent to the first board in the series. The result is that the LEDs turn on as the color specified by the input.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## Explination of Code

This section will explain how the program operates. This will include inputs and outputs, timers and PWM.

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system
